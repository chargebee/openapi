# Chargebee OpenAPI Specification

### ⚠️ Early Access

The Chargebee OpenAPI specification is currently part of our Early Access Program (EAP). Before using it, review the [terms and conditions for "Pre-Release Offerings"](https://www.chargebee.com/company/terms/#your_rights). We strongly advise against utilizing this specification for generating SDKs, particularly if they are intended for use in production systems.

## Overview

Good news for developers! We're breathing new life into the user experience of our API infrastructure. Taking the first steps on this exciting journey, we're proud to unveil the Chargebee OpenAPI Specification—a version of our [API spec](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api) now fully compliant with the [OpenAPI Specification v3.0.1](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.1). This marks the beginning of a series of improvements!

Using OpenAPI provides several advantages:
- **Open API Tooling**: Use your preferred OpenAPI-based tools for experimentation, automated testing, and validation of API requests and responses.
- **Ease of Understanding**: Since OpenAPI is a widely adopted standard, interacting with the API will be more straightforward.

While this specification is in early access, we advise against using it for generating SDKs for production systems. We're still fine-tuning the specification, and it's possible to encounter bugs at this stage.

Stay tuned for updates on when the specification will be generally available.
